## SEO Rules

### SEO-001: Title Tag Length & Brand Duplication
- **Check**: Count characters in title tag (count EVERY character including spaces and pipes). Also check brand name occurrences.
- **Pass**: 30-55 characters (hard max: 60. NEVER exceed 60.) AND brand name appears AT MOST once.
- **Fail**: Truncate or expand. If over 55, rewrite — do NOT just cut words. If brand appears 2+ times, remove duplicates immediately — this is an auto-fail.
- **Common mistake**: Brand name repeated (e.g. "Free Language Courses — Polyglot You | Polyglot You"). Verify brand appears ONCE max. Check for brand in both the title text and the separator suffix — they often duplicate.

- **Check**: Count characters in meta description (count EVERY character including spaces and punctuation)
- **Pass**: 120-155 characters (hard max: 158. NEVER exceed 158.)

- **Fail**: Add alt text

### TECH-002: Alt Text Quality
- **Check**: Alt text is descriptive
- **Pass**: Alt text describes image, includes keyword if natural
- **Fail**: Rewrite alt text

### TECH-003: No Broken Links
- **Check**: ALL links (internal AND external) point to existing, reachable pages
- **Pass**: Every link in generated content uses a real, verified URL. No placeholder URLs (example.com, #, javascript:void). No known-dead domains.
- **Fail**: Replace broken/placeholder links with real URLs, or remove the link. For external links, prefer well-known authoritative domains (Wikipedia, official docs, industry standards bodies) that are unlikely to break.

### TECH-004: Canonical Tag
- **Check**: Canonical tag present in `<head>`
- **Pass**: Self-referencing canonical present with full absolute URL
- **Fail**: Add `<link rel="canonical" href="https://..." />`. This is MANDATORY — never skip.

### TECH-005: Open Graph Tags (BLOCKER)
- **Check**: All 6 required OG tags present AS GENERATED HTML CODE in the deliverable
- **Pass**: og:title, og:description, og:image, og:url, og:type, og:site_name ALL present as `<meta property="og:..." />` tags in the delivered `<head>` block. og:image MUST have a real URL or an explicit `[TODO: provide image URL — 1200x630px]` placeholder that the user cannot miss.
- **Fail**: Generate the complete OG tag block immediately. Do NOT just list "add OG tags" in a checklist — output the actual HTML. This is a BLOCKER: content cannot be delivered without complete OG tags.
- **Why BLOCKER**: Incomplete OG causes broken social previews on Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, WhatsApp. This is visible to end users and damages brand perception.

### TECH-006: XML Sitemap
- **Check**: XML sitemap exists and is accessible
- **Pass**: sitemap.xml accessible at /sitemap.xml or declared in robots.txt
- **Fail**: Generate sitemap.xml or configure framework to auto-generate. Submit to Google Search Console AND Bing Webmaster Tools.

### TECH-007: Robots.txt
- **Check**: robots.txt file exists and is properly configured
- **Pass**: robots.txt accessible at /robots.txt with appropriate Allow/Disallow directives
- **Fail**: Create robots.txt. At minimum: allow all search engine bots, reference sitemap URL.

### TECH-008: WWW Canonicalization
- **Check**: www and non-www versions redirect to same destination
- **Pass**: One version (www or non-www) 301-redirects to the other
- **Fail**: Configure DNS/hosting to redirect. Choose one canonical domain and redirect the other with 301.

### TECH-009: Noindex Verification
- **Check**: Pages intended for indexing do NOT have noindex meta tag or X-Robots-Tag header
- **Pass**: No unintentional noindex directives present
- **Fail**: Remove noindex tag/header. Common in staging deployments that go live without removing it.

### TECH-010: Content Freshness Signals (BLOCKER)
- **Check**: Deliverable includes content freshness meta tags
- **Pass**: At least ONE of the following is present in the delivered `<head>` block:
  - `<meta property="article:modified_time" content="YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ" />` (for articles/blog posts)
  - `<meta property="og:updated_time" content="YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ" />` (universal)
  - `<meta property="article:published_time" content="YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ" />` (for first publish)
  - AND the deliverable includes a note recommending `Last-Modified` HTTP header configuration
- **Fail**: Generate the freshness meta tags with current date. Add a "Server Configuration" note explaining how to set `Last-Modified` header (Next.js: `res.setHeader('Last-Modified', ...)`, Vercel: automatic for static, nginx: `add_header Last-Modified`).
- **Why BLOCKER**: Search engines use freshness signals to rank content. Without them, content appears stale even when recently updated. Rank Math and similar tools flag this as a warning.

### TECH-011: Link Integrity
- **Check**: All URLs in generated content are real and reachable
- **Pass**: No placeholder URLs (example.com, placeholder.com, yourdomain.com, #, javascript:void). All external links use HTTPS. All URLs follow known-valid patterns.
- **Fail**: Replace placeholder URLs with real, authoritative alternatives. If the real URL is unknown, use explicit `[TODO: replace with real URL for X]` that the user cannot miss. NEVER output a fake URL that looks real.
- **Post-deploy note**: Include reminder for user to run a broken link scan after deployment (e.g., `npx broken-link-checker [url]` or online tools).
