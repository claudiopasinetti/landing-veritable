# orson

Programmatic video generation from design system + content. Generates purpose-built HTML pages with static layouts and frame-addressed animations (`window.__setFrame(n)`), captures frame-by-frame via Playwright, and encodes to video with FFmpeg.

## Commands

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `/orson create` | **Guided flow** — interactively create a video from a folder, URL, or manual input |
| `/orson render <file.html>` | Render video from HTML config (with audio) |
| `/orson render <file.html> --no-audio` | Render video without audio |
| `/orson demo <script.json>` | **Demo mode** — record a live website demo with narration, zoom, and cursor |
| `/orson formats` | List format presets |
| `/orson entrances` | List all available entrances |

---

## Step 0: Setup (automatic)

Before running ANY command, ensure the engine is ready. Run this silently — do not ask the user.

```bash
ENGINE_DIR=".claude/skills/orson/engine"

# Check if node_modules exists
if [ ! -d "$ENGINE_DIR/node_modules" ]; then
  cd "$ENGINE_DIR" && npm install && npx playwright install chromium
fi

# Check if audio library has tracks (download if missing)
if [ ! -d "$ENGINE_DIR/audio/tracks" ] || [ -z "$(ls "$ENGINE_DIR/audio/tracks/"*.mp3 2>/dev/null)" ]; then
  bash "$ENGINE_DIR/audio/download-library.sh"
fi

# Check if Python venv exists for TTS narration
VENV_DIR="$ENGINE_DIR/audio/.venv"
if [ ! -d "$VENV_DIR" ]; then
  python3 -m venv "$VENV_DIR" && "$VENV_DIR/bin/pip" install -q edge-tts
fi

# If a non-default TTS engine is configured, install its package too
if [ -n "$ORSON_TTS_ENGINE" ] && [ "$ORSON_TTS_ENGINE" != "edge-tts" ]; then
  PIP_PKG=$(python3 -c "import json; d=json.load(open('$ENGINE_DIR/audio/presets/voices.json')); print(d.get('engines',{}).get('$ORSON_TTS_ENGINE',{}).get('pip_package',''))" 2>/dev/null)
  [ -n "$PIP_PKG" ] && "$VENV_DIR/bin/pip" install -q "$PIP_PKG"
fi
```

The engine lives at `.claude/skills/orson/engine/`. All CLI commands use:
```
npx tsx .claude/skills/orson/engine/src/index.ts <command> [args]
```

**System requirement:** FFmpeg must be installed on the system (`ffmpeg` in PATH).

---

## Guided Flow (`/orson create`)

The workflow follows a filmmaking process: **Pre-production → Screenplay → Storyboard → Production**.

Use `AskUserQuestion` for each interactive step.

---

### PHASE 1: PRE-PRODUCTION

#### Step 1.1: Source

Ask the user where the content comes from:

- **from-folder `<path>`** — Analyze a local project/site folder
- **from-url `<url>`** — Fetch and analyze a live URL
- **manual** — User describes content in chat

**For folder/URL:** Run the analyzer and **read the ENTIRE source material** (not just the JSON summary):
```bash
npx tsx .claude/skills/orson/engine/src/index.ts analyze-folder <path>
```

The JSON output is a starting point, but you MUST also read the original files (README, docs, etc.) to understand:
- What is the core value proposition?
- What are ALL the features (not just the first 3-4)?
- What problems does it solve?
- Who is the target audience?
- What makes it unique vs competitors?

Show the user a comprehensive summary and ask: "Does this capture everything important? Anything missing?"

#### Step 1.2: Design System

Check for existing seurat design system:
1. Look for `<project-folder>/.seurat/tokens.css`
2. **If found** → inform user: "Found existing design system — video will use your brand."
3. **If NOT found** → invoke `/seurat extract` to create one.

#### Step 1.3: Output Location

Default output directory: `.orson/` (in the project root). Inform the user:
> "I file verranno salvati in `.orson/` — è già nel `.gitignore`."

Only ask for a custom path if the user explicitly requests one.

#### Step 1.4: Video Parameters

Collect in sequence:

**Intent:**
- Product launch / feature showcase
- Social media promo (Instagram/TikTok/YouTube Shorts)
- Explainer / tutorial teaser
- Portfolio / case study
- Custom

**Format** (suggest based on intent):
- `horizontal-16x9` (1920x1080) — YouTube, presentations
- `vertical-9x16` (1080x1920) — Reels, TikTok, Shorts
- `vertical-4x5` (1080x1350) — Instagram feed
- `square-1x1` (1080x1080) — Instagram, Twitter

**Style:**
- **safe** — Clean, corporate, professional
- **hybrid** — Clean base + one surprise per scene
- **chaos** — Dynamic, experimental, random
- **cocomelon** — Neuro-optimized, pattern interrupts, dopamine loops

**Speed:**
- **slow** — Relaxed, more reading time
- **normal** — Balanced
- **fast** — Punchy, quick cuts

#### Step 1.5: Voice

Ask the user about narration:

1. **Narration enabled?** — Yes (default) / No
2. **Voice preset** — Based on intent from Step 1.4:
   - Product launch → `promo`
   - Feature showcase → `tech-demo`
   - Social media promo → `promo`
   - Explainer → `explainer`
   - Tutorial teaser → `tutorial`
   - Portfolio / case study → `explainer`

   Suggest the preset but let the user override. Available presets: `tech-demo`, `explainer`, `promo`, `tutorial`, `sales`, `onboarding`.

   Each preset specifies voice, style, speech rate (WPM), and prosody based on peer-reviewed research. See `engine/audio/presets/voice-presets.json`.

3. **Language** — Auto-detect from content, confirm with user.
   If non-English, use locale override from voice-presets.json.

Include the chosen preset in the narration brief so `narration_generator.py` uses the correct voice and speech rate.

---

### PHASE 2: SCREENPLAY (Sceneggiatura)

This is where Claude acts as the **screenwriter**. The goal: transform raw content into a structured narrative with compelling copy.

#### Step 2.1: Scene Structure

Based on the source material analysis, design the scene structure:

1. **Identify key messages** — What MUST be in the video? (core value, differentiators, proof points)
2. **Map to scene types** — Hook, problem, solution, features, proof, CTA
3. **Decide scene count** — Based on content depth and video intent (social = 4-6 scenes, presentation = 6-10)

Present the scene outline to the user:
```
Scene 1 (Hook): [provocative question or statement]
Scene 2 (Problem): [pain point]
Scene 3 (Solution): [product intro]
Scene 4 (Feature): [key capability 1]
Scene 5 (Feature): [key capability 2]
Scene 6 (Proof): [benchmarks/social proof]
Scene 7 (CTA): [call to action]
```

Ask: "Does this structure work? Want to add/remove/reorder scenes?"

#### Step 2.2: Copywriting

Ask the user: **"Do you want me to invoke `/ghostwriter` to optimize the video text?"**

- **Yes** → Invoke `/ghostwriter` with:
  - Video intent and target platform
  - Source content summary
  - Scene structure
  - Request: punchy headlines, emotional hooks, action-oriented CTAs

- **No** → Use source text as-is (shortened for video)

**Write the copy for each scene:**
- Headlines: 3-8 words, clear value prop
- Body text: 10-20 words max per element
- CTAs: action verbs, urgency

Show the complete screenplay to the user:
```
Scene 1: "Hook"
  - Heading: "What if 100 AI agents worked for you?"

Scene 2: "The Problem"
  - Heading: "One task. One agent. One bottleneck."
  - Text: "Sequential execution is holding you back"

Scene 3: "The Solution"
  - Heading: "Kimi K2.5"
  - Text: "The world's first agentic swarm AI"

[...etc for all scenes...]
```

Ask: "Happy with the screenplay? Any text changes?"

---

### PHASE 3: STORYBOARD — Write HTML Directly

Claude writes the video HTML directly — no intermediate JSON, no autogen. This produces higher quality output because Claude controls the exact layout, styling, and animations.

#### Step 3.0: Choose Aesthetic

Before writing any HTML, read `references/visual-recipes.md` and decide:

1. **Visual recipe** — Pick one of the 24 recipes based on brand tone and intent. Apply its palette, typography, layout, animation energy, decoratives, camera, and signature CSS holistically.
2. **Color arc** — Pick an arc type (cold→warm, dark→bright, mono→chromatic, complementary shift, brand crescendo). Shift CSS custom properties per scene.
3. **Camera motion plan** — Plan a DIFFERENT camera motion for at least 3 scenes (e.g., scene 0 = push-in, scene 2 = settle, scene 4 = drift, scene 6 = static). Wrap scene content in `<div class="cam" data-el="sN-cam">` with `overflow:hidden`.
4. **Animation plan** — Before writing any A() calls, plan which entrance animations you'll use. Choose at least 5 DISTINCT entrance types from `actions.ts` (e.g., `slam` for hero, `clip-reveal-left` for body, `spring-scale` for icons, `bounce-in-up` for stats, `blur-in` for taglines). Hero/CTA scenes MUST use a "statement" entrance (`slam`, `stamp`, `scale-word`, `impact-word`, `drop`, `kinetic-push`). Consider `SP()` spring physics for bouncy/elastic entrances — it produces more natural motion than `outBack`/`outElastic`.
5. **Kinetic typography** — Pick at least 2 scenes for kinetic text. Hero headline MUST use word-by-word or impact-word reveal. CTA scene should use kinetic emphasis.
6. **Transition plan** — Choose at least 3 different scene transition types (e.g., `crossfade`, `wipe-left`, `blur`, `scale-reveal`). Never use the same transition for all scenes.
7. **CSS ambient motion** — Decorative elements are now animated by default (orb float, glow pulse, grid fade, etc.) via CSS @keyframes synced to frame capture. Add shimmer/shine on CTA buttons and premium cards. For gradient text headlines, add `amb-gradient-text` animation.
8. **Spatial fill** — Follow the fill FLOOR and CEILING targets per scene type. Under-filling (content too small) is as bad as over-filling. Headlines must span ≥60% of viewport width.

Tell the user which recipe, arc, and animation approach you chose before writing HTML.

#### Step 3.1: Write the HTML

Create `<output-dir>/video.html`. Read `references/html-contract.md` for the full HTML format specification (comment syntax, scene structure, animation script, available easings/properties, format-specific CSS). For reusable CSS layout snippets (hero, cards, code blocks, mockups, stats, SVG draw patterns), see `references/components.md`.

**Scene timing: auto-start (recommended).** Omit `start` from scenes — the runtime computes it automatically from `frames` + `XFADE`:
```javascript
var scenes = [
  { id: 'scene-0', frames: 210 },
  { id: 'scene-1', frames: 270 },
];
var XFADE = 30;
// Runtime auto-computes: scene-0.start=0, scene-1.start=180
```

**New animation functions** (see `html-contract.md` → "New Animation Functions"):
- `SP()` — Spring physics (replaces `outBack`/`outElastic` for more natural motion)
- `N()` — Perlin noise (organic drift, camera shake)
- `D()` — SVG path draw (animated underlines, connectors, logo draw-on)
- `P()` — Particle system (noise-driven animated particles)
- `R()` — Seeded random (deterministic positions)

#### Step 3.1b: Quality Validation (MANDATORY — run every check before preview)

Before previewing, self-check the HTML against ALL of these rules. This is a checklist, not a suggestion.

**A. SPATIAL FILL (see `visual-recipes.md` → "Spatial Presence")**

1. **Headline width** — Is every headline ≥60% of viewport width? (≥1152px on 16:9). If not, increase `font-size` or `max-width`.
2. **Vertical spread** — In centered layouts, does the content block (all elements + gaps) span ≥40% of viewport height (≥432px on 1080)? If it's a tiny island in the center, increase font sizes and gaps.
3. **Split layout balance** — In split layouts, does content extend from ≤25% to ≥75% of viewport height? No half-empty sides.
4. **Body text width** — Are body text containers ≥500px wide on 16:9?
5. **Gap sizing** — Are gaps between elements ≥32px? Between sections ≥48px? Gaps of 16-24px are web-scale bugs in video.

**B. TYPOGRAPHY (see `html-contract.md` → "Video Scale Requirements")**

6. **Hero headline** — ≥80px on 16:9, ≥96px on 9:16, ≥72px on 1:1.
7. **Body text** — ≥28px on 16:9.
8. **Stat values** — ≥96px on 16:9.
9. **Contrast** — No text with contrast < 4.5:1. On dark BG (#000–#1a1a1a), dimmest text is #808080.

**C. COMPONENT SIZING**

10. **Cards** — min-width ≥40% of viewport (≥768px on 1920).
11. **CTA button** — font-size ≥24px, padding ≥20px 56px.
12. **Icons** — ≥48px.

**D. ANIMATION DIVERSITY (see `visual-recipes.md` → "Animation Diversity")**

13. **Entrance variety** — Count distinct entrance animation types across the entire video. Minimum: **5 different types from at least 3 different categories**. Categories: fade-family (fade-in-*), slide-family (slide-*), clip-family (clip-reveal-*), spring-family (spring-*, SP()), bounce-family (bounce-in-*), kinetic (word-by-word, char-stagger, impact-word), statement (slam, stamp, drop, kinetic-push), special (blur-in, zoom-in, elastic-in). If all 5 are from the same category (e.g. all fade variants), that's NOT variety — ADD from other categories.
14. **No consecutive duplicates** — In each scene, no two consecutive elements may use the same entrance animation.
15. **Hero/CTA statement entrance** — Scene 0 headline and final CTA must use a "statement" animation (`slam`, `stamp`, `scale-word`, `impact-word`, `drop`, `kinetic-push`, or `SP()` with scale 3→1), NOT `fade-in-up`.
16. **Transition variety** — Count distinct scene transitions. Minimum: **3 different types** in a 6+ scene video. Not all crossfade.
17. **Camera variety** — Count distinct camera motions. Minimum: **2 different types**. At least 3 scenes must have camera animation.
18. **Kinetic typography** — At least **2 scenes** use kinetic text (word-by-word, char-stagger, impact-word, typewriter).
19. **Easing variety** — Are you using at least 3 different easings? Mix: `outCubic`, `outBack`, `outExpo`, `outElastic`, `outBounce`.
20. **Exit animations** — In at least half the scenes, the main content element has an explicit exit animation (not just scene crossfade).

**D2. v6 FUNCTION USAGE (MANDATORY — prevents A()-only monotony)**

21. **SP() usage** — At least **1 element** must use `SP()` spring physics instead of A() with outBack/outElastic. Best candidates: hero headline slam, CTA button pop, icon bounce-in, card drop. Count your SP() calls — if zero, add one.
22. **N() usage** — At least **1 decorative element or camera** must use `N()` noise. Best candidates: background orb drift (x+y), camera shake on hero/impact scene, floating badge/pill. Count your N() calls — if zero, add one.
23. **D() usage** — At least **1 SVG element** must use `D()` path draw. Best candidates: underline under heading, connector between features, circle outline, logo draw-on. If the video has no SVG elements, add a curved underline SVG under the hero or CTA headline.
24. **P() or N()-decorative** — At least **1 scene** must have ambient organic motion: either P() particles or N() on decorative elements (orbs, blobs). Static backgrounds with no ambient motion = slideshow.
25. **CSS ambient motion** — At least **2 decorative elements** must have CSS ambient animation (float, pulse-glow, breathe, grid-fade). Static decoratives with no ambient motion = flat. The runtime syncs CSS animations to frame capture automatically.
26. **Shimmer/shine** — At least **1 CTA button or premium card** should have a `amb-shine` or `amb-shimmer` effect for premium feel.

**E. VISUAL VARIETY**

27. **Layout alternation** — No more than 2 consecutive scenes with the same layout type (centered/centered/centered = bug).
28. **Text-only limit** — Max 3 consecutive text-only scenes. At least 1 scene must have a non-text visual.
29. **Color arc** — Can you visually tell scenes apart by color? If the shift is imperceptible, increase it.

**If ANY check fails, fix it BEFORE proceeding to preview.** This is the difference between a video and a slideshow.

#### Step 3.2: Preview & Verify

Use the interactive preview to check the HTML before rendering:
```bash
npx tsx .claude/skills/orson/engine/src/index.ts render <output-dir>/video.html --preview
```

Verify:
- All scenes display correctly (no text overflow, no overlapping elements)
- Content fills the viewport adequately (no "tiny island in vast darkness" scenes)
- Animations are diverse (each scene feels distinct, not the same fade-in-up repeated)
- Scene transitions vary (not all crossfade)
- Kinetic typography plays correctly on hero/CTA scenes
- Camera motions differ between scenes
- Colors and typography match the design system

If issues found, fix the HTML directly and re-preview.

Show the user a summary:
```
Video HTML ready (7 scenes, 28.5s total):
  1. "Hook" (3.5s) — "Frame-Perfect Video"
  2. "The Problem" (4.5s) — "Screen Recording Is Dead"
  [...]
```

Ask: "Ready to render?"

---

### PHASE 4: PRODUCTION

#### Step 4.1: Render

```bash
npx tsx .claude/skills/orson/engine/src/index.ts render <output-dir>/video.html
```

For faster rendering on multi-core systems:
```bash
npx tsx .claude/skills/orson/engine/src/index.ts render <output-dir>/video.html --parallel
```

Report output path and stats when done.

---

## Audio System

Orson includes an integrated audio system for background music and narration. Audio is automatically added during `render` (use `--no-audio` to skip).

### How Audio Selection Works

1. **Mode filtering** — Video mode (safe/chaos/hybrid/cocomelon) determines allowed music styles via `coherence-matrix.json`
2. **Context matching** — Video context tags are matched against style definitions
3. **Energy matching** — Track energy level is matched to video energy
4. **Track processing** — Selected track is trimmed/looped to video duration, faded in/out
5. **Merge** — Processed audio is merged into the final MP4

### TTS Engines

Narration uses a pluggable TTS engine architecture. Any provider can be added; Edge-TTS is the built-in fallback (free, no API key).

**Engine selection priority:**
1. `ttsEngine` field in demo script JSON
2. `ORSON_TTS_ENGINE` environment variable
3. Auto-detect: first available non-edge-tts engine
4. Fallback: `edge-tts`

| Engine | Prosody | Languages | API Key | Pip Package |
|--------|---------|-----------|---------|-------------|
| `edge-tts` (default) | Yes (rate, pitch) | 75+ incl. Italian | None | `edge-tts` |
| `elevenlabs` | Partial (speed, style) | 70+ incl. Italian | `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY` | `elevenlabs` |

To add a new TTS engine, read `references/tts-extension.md`.

### Narration Pipeline

1. Generate a narration brief (JSON) with text + timing per element
2. Run `narration_generator.py` — selects engine, produces MP3 files
3. Use `audio-mixer.ts` to concatenate, duck music, and merge

```bash
# Using default engine (edge-tts)
python .claude/skills/orson/engine/audio/narration_generator.py brief.json ./.orson/narration/

# List available voices for active engine
python .claude/skills/orson/engine/audio/narration_generator.py --list-voices

# List registered engines
python .claude/skills/orson/engine/audio/narration_generator.py --list-engines
```

### Audio Library

Tracks live in `engine/audio/tracks/` and SFX in `engine/audio/sfx/`. The catalog is in `engine/audio/presets/audio-library.json`.

Run `engine/audio/download-library.sh` to bootstrap placeholder tracks. Replace with real CC0 audio from Pixabay, Mixkit, or similar.

### Contextual SFX

Sound effects are automatically added based on video actions. Available SFX types: `ui-click`, `typing-loop`, `transition`, `scene-transition`, `success`.

**Demo mode:** SFX are auto-generated from actions (click → click sound, fill → typing loop, navigate → transition). Control via the `sfx` field in the demo script:

```json
{
  "sfx": {
    "enabled": true,
    "volume": 0.7,
    "autoFromActions": true
  }
}
```

Per-step override with `"sfx": "ui-click"` (explicit) or `"sfx": "none"` (silence).

**HTML video:** Add `sfx` attribute to `@scene` comments:
```html
<!-- @scene name="Demo" sfx="click@1500,typing@2000:3000,whoosh@5000" -->
```
Format: `type@startMs` or `type@startMs:durationMs`. Timestamps are relative to scene start.

SFX are mixed at gain 0.7 (below narration at 1.0) and go through the same -14 LUFS normalization.

---

## Demo Mode (`/orson demo`)

Record a live website demo with narration, zoom, cursor animation, and background music.

### Guided Flow

Use `AskUserQuestion` for each step.

#### Pre-production

1. **URL** — Ask for the website URL to demo
2. **Auth** — Does the site require login? If yes, collect auth steps (URL, selectors, credentials)
3. **Format** — `horizontal-16x9` (default for demos), or other
4. **Voice** — Use a voice preset from `engine/audio/presets/voice-presets.json` based on demo type:
   - Product demo → `tech-demo`
   - Feature explainer → `explainer`
   - Marketing demo → `promo`
   - Tutorial walkthrough → `tutorial`
   - Or specify an explicit voice name (overrides preset)
5. **Music** — Enabled? Style auto or specific? Volume (default 0.3)?

#### Screenplay

Design the demo script step-by-step:

1. For each feature to demonstrate, define:
   - **narration** — What to say (conversational, 1-2 sentences)
   - **action** — What to do (click, fill, scroll, hover, navigate, wait, none)
   - **selector** — CSS selector for the action target
   - **value** — Text to type (for fill) or URL (for navigate)
   - **zoom** — Zoom level (1-3, optional)
   - **highlight** — Show ring around target (optional)

2. Present the screenplay to the user for approval

#### Production

Write the script JSON and run:

```bash
npx tsx .claude/skills/orson/engine/src/index.ts demo <script.json>
```

For demo script JSON format, field reference, authentication patterns, and framework compatibility notes, read `references/demo-format.md`.

### Demo Pipeline

1. Parse + validate script (Zod)
2. Generate narration brief → run `narration_generator.py` → MP3 files (loudness normalized to -14 LUFS by audio-mixer.ts)
3. Build narration-first timeline (zoom → narration → action)
3.5. Build SFX track from actions (auto) or explicit per-step overrides
4. Launch Playwright, pre-flight selector validation, execute auth, record frames
5. Encode frames to video (FFmpeg)
6. Process audio: concatenate narration → build SFX track → select music → duck → mix all three → merge
7. Generate WebVTT subtitles

### Pre-flight Checks

Before recording, the engine validates:
1. All selectors exist on the initial page (warning if not found — selectors for post-navigation pages are expected to be missing)
2. Python venv is available with edge-tts installed (auto-created if missing)
3. Music tracks are available (downloaded or silence placeholders)
